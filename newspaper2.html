During that keynote address, Tim Cook and other Apple executives will reveal the future of the company’s software efforts. Of course, Apple will preview the next version of iOS that could fundamentally change its iPhones. But this year’s changes on iOS are likely to be less dramatic. That being said, we are still
             expecting a lot of new features <br> to be rolled out as part of iOS 15 <br><br>
             iOS 15
It’s all but certain that Apple will announce the next version of iOS, <br>the operating system that powers the iPhone next week. 
For iOS 15, rumours say that that  iOS will bring more granular controls over notifications. Apparently, users will be able to set different notification preferences depending on their current status (for example, sleeping or driving). iOS 15 might also add new device privacy protections, an updated lock screen and a redesigned iPad home screen with widgets. 
Apple is also rumoured to be working on revamping iMessage, with the aim to turn into a competitor to WhatsApp. </p>
